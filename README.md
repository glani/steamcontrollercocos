# steamcontrollercocos - NOT Steam SDK implementation of Steam Controller for Cocos2d Game engine
Core files that are a base implementation of cocos2d api. It is supposed to be used as a part of any cocos2d project.
The implementation is similar to Controller.cpp that is the part of cocos2d engine.

This is a C++ library for Linux and Windows based operating systems that allows accessing 
the Steam Wireless Controller as a gamepad in the same way like a common gamepad. 

There is no requirement for **Steam SDK libraries**.

However, it is likely that this project will be extended to support Steam SDK as well.

Please look at the demo how it works: [Cocos2D Demo](https://github.com/glani/steamcontrollercocos2d)
